# ArchInstall Tutorial

This is a markdown file with detailed steps to install a base system of Arch Linux and is intended for people that do not want to use the several available installation scripts to install Arch automatically.
If you are somewhat comfortable with Linux and the terminal then going through these steps should not be a problem.
The steps will leave you with a working minimal Arch installation. Minimal means only the base system WITHOUT a GUI. Feel free to install whatever graphical environment you want. KDE, Gnome or simply a window manager like dwm, i3, etc.
